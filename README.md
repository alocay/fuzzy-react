# FuzzyJS

WIP  - A React version of [FuzzyJS](http://github.com/alocay/fuzzjs)

## Examples
_(Coming soon)_

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the "lib" subdirectory!_
